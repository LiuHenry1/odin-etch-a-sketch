The Odin Project: [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

## Overview
The fourth project in The Odin Project curriculum. Topics covered:
<ul>
  <li>DOM</li>
  <li>More practice on Javascript</li>
  <li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>Git</li>
</ul>

## Reflection
Probably one of my best projects so far in terms of aesthetics
and functionality. Even more practice with flexbox, getting really
comfortable with it. As for javascript, starting to feel more comfortable
with its syntax and event listeners. Need more practice with code styling
however.
